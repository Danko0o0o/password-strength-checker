            <h2>Why Password Strength Matters</h2>
            <p>Weak passwords are vulnerable to cracking methods like brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. Even short, simple passwords can be cracked in seconds!</p>
            <h3>Convenience vs. Security</h3>
            <p>Using complex passwords can seem inconvenient, but tools like <strong>password managers</strong> help you store and generate strong, unique passwords without having to memorize them all.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a password manager to protect your accounts without sacrificing convenience!</p>

            <summary><strong>Why Are Some Passwords Easy to Crack?</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Weak passwords can be cracked using several methods:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Brute-force attacks:</strong> try every possible combination of characters. Short passwords fall quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Dictionary attacks:</strong> use lists of common passwords, phrases, or leaked credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern-based attacks:</strong> predict passwords based on user tendencies, like “name123” or “qwerty”.</li>
                </ul>
                The <code>zxcvbn</code> library simulates these techniques to score password strength and estimate crack time.

            <summary><strong>Why We Recommend Password Managers</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Many users rely on <em>mental shortcuts</em> to choose passwords, such as using familiar words or patterns. This comes from:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Availability heuristics:</strong> picking words that are easy to recall (names, keyboard patterns).</li>
                <li><strong>Optimism bias:</strong> assuming "it won’t happen to me" when choosing weak passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Bounded rationality:</strong> users often settle for “good enough” due to time or memory constraints.</li>
                </ul>
                A password manager removes the need to memorize complex passwords and helps reduce these biases by generating and storing strong ones automatically.

            <summary><strong>How This Tool Helps You Build Better Password Habits</strong></summary>
            <p>
                This tool doesn't just rate your password, it explains why it's weak and gives realistic estimates for how fast it could be cracked.
                <br><br>
                This advice is based on how people really behave, not just ideal rules. By showing you risk clearly and offering simple solutions (like password managers), your security will be improved without making life harder.
